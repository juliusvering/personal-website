While working on a consulting project for Aptiv PLC, I was wondering about the technical side of working with connected cars. To test out the technology, I built an API using Flask and Python to be able to interact with GM cars that use the OnStar service. Using my API, I could get various data from the vehicle and simulate different actions such as locking the doors or starting the engine.
