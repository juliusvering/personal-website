# The platform

"guse" provides people who don't count themselves as finance experts or investment gurus with a tool to make the right decisions in terms of personal finance. With a few simple steps, users create an account and provide the algorithm with enough information to pick out promising securities and assemble them into a portfolio.

The algorithm uses traditional financial models to create a qualitative assessment of each security traded on major US markets. In addition, it pulls in recent news reports on the security. Using machine learning, namely sentiment analysis through natural language processing, the algorithm creates a quantitative assessment of the security to enhance the traditional, qualitative analysis.

The platform is built using the modern frontend framework React JS, to provide a responsive UI that looks good both on mobile and desktop devices. Behind the scenes runs a reliable backend built with Python and the Django framework to perform analyses and manage the data stored on a MongoDB database.

# The project

"guse" is the result of a Calhacks project. Calhacks in the world's largest collegiate hackathon.  In a 36 hour sprint, my team and I built the entire platform from scratch. Our work impressed the judges and we were honored with the first place in the IBM challenge, competing with over 2,000 other hackers.
